PyCity Schools Analysis:

Schools with higher budgets did not yield better test results. Schools with higher spending per student ($645-$675) actually underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (<$585 per student).
When it comes to math, smaller and medium sized schools outperformed larger schools (89-91% passing vs 67%).
Charter schools outperformed public schools on all metrics. More analysis will be needed to see if their performance is due to school practices or smaller student populations per school.
